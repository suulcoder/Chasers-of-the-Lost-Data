# Chasers-of-the-Lost-Data
The Challenge Help find ways to improve the performance of machine learning and predictive models by filling in gaps in the datasets prior to model training. This entails finding methods to computationally recover or approximate data that is missing due to sensor issues or signal noise that compromises experimental data collection. This work is inspired by data collection during additive manufacturing (AM) processes where sensors capture build characteristics in-situ, but it has applications across many NASA domains.
